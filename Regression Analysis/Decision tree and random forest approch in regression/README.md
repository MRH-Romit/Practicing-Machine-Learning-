# Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression

This folder contains my practice work on Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression.

## Dataset

- **File**: `Position_Salaries.csv`
- **Description**: A dataset containing position levels and corresponding salaries.

## Implementation

- **File**: `decision_tree.ipynb`
- **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook implementing Decision Tree Regression to predict salaries based on position levels.

- **File**: `random_forest.ipynb`
- **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook implementing Random Forest Regression to predict salaries based on position levels.

## Results

- Visualized the decision tree regression curve.
- Visualized the random forest regression curve.
- Predicted salaries for given position levels.
