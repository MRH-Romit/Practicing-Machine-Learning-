# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

This folder contains my practice work on Support Vector Regression.

## Dataset
- **File**: `Position_Salaries.csv`
- **Description**: A dataset containing position levels and corresponding salaries. i've found what i'll get like if a person's work level is 5.5 or 6.5 a mid point.

## Implementation
- **File**: `SVR.ipynb`
- **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook implementing Support Vector Regression to predict salaries based on position levels.

## Results
- Visualized the SVR prediction curve.
- Predicted salaries for given position levels.
