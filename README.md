## 📁 Project Structure

- `Salary_Data.csv` – Sample dataset used for regression analysis.
- `linear_regression.py` – Basic linear regression implementation.
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies used in the project.
- `machine-learning-env/` – Local virtual environment (excluded from Git).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv machine-learning-env
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
.\machine-learning-env\Scripts\activate
```

On Linux/macOS:

```bash
source machine-learning-env/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run your machine learning scripts:

```bash
python linear_regression.py
```
