## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv machine-learning-env
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\machine-learning-env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    source machine-learning-env/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run your machine learning scripts**:
    ```bash
    python linear_regression.py
    ```
