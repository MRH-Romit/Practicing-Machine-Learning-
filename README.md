# My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning practice repository! Here, I'm documenting my learning journey as I explore various ML concepts and techniques. Each folder contains hands-on projects and notes.

## Topics Covered

- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machines**
- And more advanced topics like Clustering, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning!

## How to Use

1. Browse through the folders to explore specific topics.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to see the code and visualizations.
3. Follow along or use the notes to start your own ML journey.

## Setting Up the Environment

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries to run the notebooks and experiments.
